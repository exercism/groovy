# Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[Groovy resources page](https://exercism.io/tracks/groovy/resources).

Run the tests by executing the test script.

```sh
$ gradle test
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
