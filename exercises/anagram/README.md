# Anagram

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```sh

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
