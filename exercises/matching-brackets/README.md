# Matching Brackets

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`,
or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched
and nested correctly.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[Groovy resources page](https://exercism.io/tracks/groovy/resources).

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Groovy to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/groovy/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/groovy/installation)

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```sh
$ gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
