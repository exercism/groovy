Run the tests by executing the test script.

```
$ groovy ./HelloWorldSpec.groovy
```

The test files should also have the execution bit set.  In most environments, you should also be able to execute them directly.

```
$ ./HelloWorldSpec.groovy
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
