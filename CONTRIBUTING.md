## Working on exercises

We welcome both improvements to the existing exercises and additions of new ones.
A list of missing exercises can be found here: http://exercism.io/languages/groovy/todo

This guide might be helpful before you start implementing the exercise: [Porting an Exercise to Another Language Track](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/implement-an-exercise-from-specification.md)

### Code Style
It's expected that your code follows the official Style guide: http://groovy-lang.org/style-guide.html

### Testing
Instead of using JUnit we prefer [Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) ~for consistency~ because it's an awesome framework!

## Pull Requests
It would be awesome if you follow this [simple guidelines](https://github.com/exercism/legacy-docs/blob/main/contributing/pull-request-guidelines.md) while creating your PR, but it isn't required.
